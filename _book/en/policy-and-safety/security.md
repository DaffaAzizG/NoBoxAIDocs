# Security

## Security

NoBox provides Software as a Service (SaaS) products to millions of people to solve their business problems. Security is a key component in our offerings, reflected in our employees, processes, and products. This page covers topics such as data security, operational security, and physical security to explain how we ensure security for our customers.

## Security Organization

We have an Information Security Management System that considers our security objectives and risks, along with mitigation related to all interested parties. We implement strict policies and procedures covering the security, availability, processing, integrity, and confidentiality of customer data.

## **Employee Background Check**

Each employee undergoes a background verification process. We do this to verify their criminal records, previous employment history if any, and educational background. Until these checks are completed, employees are not assigned tasks that may pose a risk to users.

## **Security Awareness**

Every employee, upon induction, signs a confidentiality agreement and an acceptable use policy, after which they undergo training in information security, privacy, and compliance. Next, we assess their understanding through tests and quizzes to determine which topics they need further training in. We provide training on specific security aspects they may require based on their role.

We continuously educate our employees on information security, privacy, and compliance within our internal community where they regularly check in to stay updated on organizational security practices. We also host internal events to raise awareness and encourage innovation in security and privacy.

## **Special Security and Privacy Team**

We have a dedicated security and privacy team that implements and manages our security and privacy programs. They design and maintain our defense systems, develop review processes for security, and continuously monitor our network for suspicious activities. They provide domain-specific consulting services and guidance to our engineering teams.
