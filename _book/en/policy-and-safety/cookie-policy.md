# Cookie Policy

## **What is a cookie?**

A cookie is a small text file stored on your computer or other internet-connected devices to identify your browser, provide analysis, and remember information about you such as your language preferences or login information. Cookies are completely safe and cannot be used to run programs or transmit viruses to your device. You can learn more about cookies by clicking [here](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-in/learning/privacy/what-are-cookies/) (external link).

## **What types of cookies does NoBox use?**

Cookies can either be session cookies or persistent cookies. Session cookies automatically expire when you close your browser. Persistent cookies remain until they expire or you delete them. The expiration date is set within the cookie itself; some may expire after a few minutes while others may last for several years. Cookies placed by the website you visit are called "first-party cookies."

## **What are third-party cookies?**

Third-party cookies are cookies not set by the website you visit. Some of NoBox's own technology and applications might be hosted on domains that are third parties to the domain you might visit. However, our commitment extends equally to these domains.

NoBox does not allow third-party tracking companies to set cookies or other trackers on our website as part of our commitment to protect our users' privacy diligently. When we embed content hosted on third-party platforms on our website, those third parties may set cookies in your browser typically for the purpose of providing the intended service (such as for bandwidth management, to store your language preferences, track consent, and to collect anonymous statistics such as how many times a video has been streamed). Whenever possible, we choose the most privacy-friendly option like Privacy Mode, Anonymous Statistics Only, to ensure we protect your privacy.

## **How can you manage cookies?**

**Browser settings:**

Most browsers allow you to control cookies through their 'settings' preferences. However, if you restrict the ability of websites to set cookies, you may worsen your overall user experience as it will no longer be personalized for you. This might also prevent you from saving personalized settings such as login information.

Browser manufacturers provide help pages related to managing cookies in their products. Please see below for more information.
