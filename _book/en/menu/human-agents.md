# <i class="fa-regular fa-users"></i> Human Agents

Human Agents in NoBox.Ai are the control center for managing all human users who have access to your platform. This feature allows you to invite team members, assign roles, and control their access rights. If AI Agents are virtual robots, then Human Agents are your real-world team—such as customer service staff, managers, and administrators—responsible for operating, monitoring, and managing customer interactions.

In this view, you can see a list of all agents along with their details. Below is an explanation of each main column:

<table data-header-hidden> <thead><tr><th width="150">Column</th><th>Function</th></tr></thead> <tbody> <tr><td><strong>Name & Email</strong></td><td>The unique identity of each agent. The name is used for internal identification, while the email is used for login and notifications.</td></tr> <tr><td><strong>Join Date</strong></td><td>The date and time when the agent first joined or registered on the platform.</td></tr> <tr><td><strong>Status</strong></td><td>Indicates the verification status of the agent's account. A <strong><code>VERIFIED</code></strong> status means the agent has successfully confirmed their email and the account is fully active.</td></tr> <tr><td><strong>Roles</strong></td><td>The role or title that determines the level of access the agent has in the system. Examples: <code>Owner</code>, <code>Manager</code>, <code>Chat Agent</code>. Roles are crucial to limit which features each team member can access.</td></tr> </tbody> </table>

## **Inviting a New Agent**

Adding Human Agents is done via an invitation system for security purposes. To invite a new agent, click the **➔[Copy Invitation]** button.

This action will copy a unique invitation link. Send this link to the prospective team member. Once they register through the link, their account will be automatically added to the Human Agents list with **[VERIFIED]** status.

The **[Unlimited]** label next to it indicates that you can invite as many agents as needed without any quota limits.

## Edit and Delete Human Agents Data

To edit Human Agent data, first select the data you want to modify (for example, by clicking on the agent’s name). Edit data such as roles and click **[Save]** to store the changes.

To delete a Human Agent, select the data you want to delete, then click the **Delete (trash bin)** icon. A confirmation dialog will appear asking whether you want to delete the data. Click **[Yes]** to confirm, or **[No]** to cancel.
