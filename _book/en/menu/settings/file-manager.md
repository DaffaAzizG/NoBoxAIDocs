# File Manager



File Manager functions as a centralized storage hub in Nobox.Ai to manage all digital assets, where users can easily search, filter, and delete files. Its main goal is to keep all files organized and easily accessible for efficient reuse across various features within the platform.

#### Managing Files in File Manager

To simplify management, you can utilize the search and filtering features to find the files you need. If you want to know how much data has been used, **click on the \[Size All Files] option** available. This option will display the total size of all files, making it easier to monitor storage usage.
