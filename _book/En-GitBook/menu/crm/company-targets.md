Once you have completed all the fields, click **\[Save]** to store the new company target data you have just created.

## **Edit and Delete Company Target Data**&#x20;

To edit a target company’s data, please first select which data to edit. Edit your data and click **\[Save]** to store the changes.

To delete a company's target data, select the target data you want to delete, then click **\[Delete]**. A confirmation dialog will appear asking if you want to delete the data. If yes, click **\[Yes]**; otherwise, click **\[No]**.

The current revenue will be displayed when the offer associated with the company reaches the \[Won] status. Example: For the PT SEJAHTERA offer, where the bid price is 18,000,000 and has reached the **Won** status, the target company's goal will display data amounting to 18,000,000.
