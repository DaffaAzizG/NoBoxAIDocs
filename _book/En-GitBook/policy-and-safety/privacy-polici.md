# Privacy Polici

## **NoBox Privacy Commitment**

We only ask for a small amount of necessary information, collecting only what we believe is essential for conducting business or for specific transactions. We inform customers about the information we have on them and allow them to opt-out of certain engagements. Importantly, our greatest commitment is that we do not make a single dollar from advertising revenue—never have, and never will—even from the free edition of our product. This means we avoid fundamental conflicts of interest between collecting customer information and increasing advertising revenue, and the inevitable compromise in customer privacy it entails.

The purpose of this policy is to clarify what information we collect, how we will use it, and how we will not use it. Unfortunately, this policy is longer than we would like, but we must address all relevant cases clearly. We will try to keep the language as simple and direct as possible.

## **Scope of Privacy Policy**

This Privacy Policy applies to all NoBox websites linked to it. It also applies to products and services provided by NoBox through these websites, our mobile applications, and applications posted by NoBox in our online marketplace and other third-party online marketplaces. This Privacy Policy does not apply to our websites, products, or services that have separate privacy policies.

This Privacy Policy is divided into three sections:

**Section I – Information Collected and Controlled by NoBox**

This section discusses how NoBox collects and uses information about website visitors, prospective customers, users of NoBox products and services, and others who contact NoBox through the forms or email addresses published on or linked to our website.

**Section II – Information Processed by NoBox on Your Behalf**

This section discusses how NoBox handles the data you entrust to NoBox when you use our products and services or when you share any personal or confidential information with us while requesting customer support.

**Section III – General**

This section discusses topics relevant to Sections I and II, and other general topics such as NoBox's security commitments and how we will notify you when we change this Privacy Policy.
