## **Section of this Agreement**

This agreement consists of the following terms and conditions (hereinafter referred to as "General Terms") and, if any, specific terms and conditions for the use of individual Services (hereinafter referred to as "Service Specific Terms"). In the event of a conflict between the General Terms and the Service Specific Terms, the Service Specific Terms shall prevail.

## **Acceptance of Agreement**

You must be of legal age to form a binding contract to accept the Agreement. If you do not agree with the General Terms, do not use our Services. If you agree with the General Terms but disagree with any Service-Specific Terms, do not use the related Services. You can accept the Agreement by checking a box or clicking a button indicating your acceptance of the Agreement or by actually using the Services.

## **Service Description**

You can create and edit content with your user account, and if you choose to do so, you may publish and share that content.

## **Beta Service**

We may offer certain services as closed or open beta services ("Beta Services") for testing and evaluation purposes.

You are not obligated to obtain a subscription to use any paid Services resulting from your subscription to any Beta Services. We reserve the right to discontinue entirely or in part, at any time and from time to time, temporarily or permanently, any of the Beta Services with or without notice to you. You agree that NoBox will not be liable to you or any third party for any losses related to, arising from, or caused by the modification, suspension, or termination of any Beta Services for any reason.
