# Abuse Policy

## Abuse Policy

We take all reports of abuse related to NoBox seriously and are dedicated to investigating any violations submitted to us. If you find content on NoBox that you believe violates our [Terms of Service](https://crm.nobox.ai/knowledge-base/article/terms-of-service), please report the violation. Once you submit a report, we will investigate and take appropriate action. We will contact you only if we need additional details or have more information to share. We may close your report without a response if we believe the incident reported does not constitute a violation.

#### Types of Abuse

We have categorized various types of abuse into the following categories:

* Spam, Malware, and Phishing – Users are prohibited from using the NoBox Service for sending "junk mail," "spam," "chain letters," "phishing," or unsolicited mass email distribution. An example of a phishing attempt is an email asking you to disclose your credit card number to qualify for a reward amount.
* Promotion of Hatred, Violence, or Illegal/Offensive Activity – Transmitting or publishing any content that (i) is unlawful, illegal, hateful, promotes racism or discrimination or hatred based on ethnicity, and (ii) is defamatory, harassing, stalking, threatening, or violates the privacy and legal rights of others, is explicitly considered a prohibited activity by NoBox.
* Explicit Sexual Material – Explicit sexual material includes content of an adult nature. We do not allow users to publish or transmit explicit sexual material using NoBox Services.
* Child Exploitation – We have a zero-tolerance policy against content that exploits children. This means we will terminate any user account found sharing or publishing child abuse content. We will also report the content and its owner to law enforcement authorities.
* Personal and Confidential Information – We do not permit the use of NoBox services to publish personal and confidential information of individuals that are not publicly accessible without their explicit consent. Examples include full names, phone numbers, addresses, social security numbers, credit card numbers, government-issued ID details, and bank information.
* Copyright Infringement – Copyright infringement occurs when someone other than the copyright holder copies the "expression" of a work. If you find that copyright infringement by a NoBox user involving your work has occurred, we will take necessary actions as determined.
* Other Violations – If you believe you have a violation to report not included in any of the categories above, you may choose this to report the violation. Please note that you will be asked to provide a description of the violation so we can take appropriate action.
