# Anti-Spam Policy

## **Anti-Spam Policy**

This policy applies to all NoBox Services that can be used to send mass or commercial emails ("Covered Services").

By agreeing to NoBox's Anti-Spam Policy, you accept it as a prerequisite for using the Covered Services. The Covered Services can only be used to send emails or messages to individuals from whom you have written permission to do so, such as permission-based email marketing. We take our Anti-Spam Policy very seriously. If we find that you are sending emails or messages to others without their consent, we reserve the right to terminate your user account.

By "permission," we mean explicit and verifiable consent given to you. Permission to send commercial emails can be obtained through:

* Requesting an email address as part of downloading anything from your website or ordering a product or service from you.
* Subscribe to the email newsletter by filling out the form on your website.
* Someone has provided you with an email address as part of participation in a contest, event, or survey you are conducting, and you have informed them that you will send them marketing emails.
* Every instance where an individual filling out the form has checked the opt-in box indicating their willingness to be contacted by you via email, provided the checkbox was not pre-selected by default and you have informed the person that the nature of the email will be commercial.
* Each business card given by someone who has expressed their consent to receive commercial emails. Consent to receive commercial emails will be considered where the business card is dropped at your booth at the trade show.

The rule of thumb is "Do not use the Covered Services to send emails or messages to email addresses for which you do not have written permission to send emails regarding the subject of the email." We require 100% compliance with the above rule.

When we say 100%, we do not include cases where the email recipient has marked it as Spam, even though you have verifiable permission to send emails to that address. Keep in mind that permission once given is considered revoked if the recipient has opted out of receiving emails from you.

Specifically, you must strictly adhere to the following rules, which clarify the aforementioned Rules of Practice:

* You must have explicit permission to contact the recipient about your email's subject. You must keep sufficient evidence that you have obtained consent from all recipients of the emails you send through the Covered Services.
* You must not import or email addresses that you have purchased, borrowed, rented, or obtained in any way from third parties, regardless of any claims about quality or permission, when using the Covered Services. You should also refrain from importing into your Covered Services account or sending mail to email addresses that you have collected from other websites.
* You must ensure that the routing information and headers, including your email "From" and "To," the domain names, and the original email addresses are correct and accurate.
* You must not use subject lines that mislead the recipient about the content or topic of the message.
* You must provide a one-click unsubscribe option in all emails and refrain from sending emails to individuals who have opted out or unsubscribed from your mailing list. Opt-out requests must be fulfilled within 10 days from the date of the request.
* You must include your valid physical mailing address in all emails sent through the Covered Services.
* You must include a clear notification in all marketing emails that the message is an advertisement or solicitation and that the recipient can opt out of receiving more commercial emails from you.

We may, at any time, ask you to prove that you have written permission to send emails to the email addresses you have imported into the Covered Services, regardless of whether you have sent marketing emails to those addresses.

Your use of the Covered Services constitutes your unconditional acceptance of this Anti-Spam Policy.
